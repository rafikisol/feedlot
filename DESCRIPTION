Description: A small package of wrapper functions for regression kriging for a project concerning tidymodels and gstat. Most functions come from publications, specifically, Malone et al. (2017) but have been converted into functions using stars and sf objects. Although for a specific project, some may find a lot of functions useful for their own projects.
